    "## Q1. What is data encoding? How is it useful in data science?\n",
    "\n",
    "*Data encoding* is the process of converting categorical data into a numerical format so that it can be processed by machine learning algorithms. Since most machine learning models require numerical input, encoding is crucial for converting non-numeric data into a suitable format. Encoding helps in simplifying the data structure, making it easier to model and analyze patterns within the data."

    "\n",
    "*Nominal encoding*, also known as label encoding, is a method where each unique category value is assigned an integer value. This type of encoding is used when the categorical data is not ordinal, meaning there is no inherent order among the categories.\n",

    "\n",
    "Nominal encoding is preferred over one-hot encoding when the categorical data has a large number of unique values and the machine learning algorithm can handle ordinal data, or when the algorithm can interpret the encoded values meaningfully without implying an ordinal relationship.\n",

    "*Example:*\n",
    "In a dataset with the \"Country\" column having many unique country names, nominal encoding is more efficient in terms of memory usage and computational complexity compared to one-hot encoding, which would create a sparse matrix with many columns.\n"

    "\n",
    "If the categorical data has no inherent order and the number of unique values is small (5 in this case), *one-hot encoding* is generally preferred. This is because it avoids any ordinal relationship between the categories that nominal encoding might imply.\n",
