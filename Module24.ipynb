    "Multithreading in Python is a technique that allows multiple threads to be executed concurrently, sharing the same memory space. It is used to perform multiple operations at the same time, making programs faster and more efficient, especially in tasks involving I/O operations such as reading/writing to files, network operations, etc. The module used to handle threads in Python is called threading."

    "- *Concurrency*: Allows multiple tasks to run concurrently, improving performance.\n",
    "- *Resource Sharing*: Threads share the same memory space, which helps in sharing data quickly and efficiently.\n",

    "Disadvantages:\n",
    "- *Complexity*: Writing and debugging multithreaded programs can be complex.\n",
    "- *Race Conditions*: Can lead to inconsistent results if multiple threads modify shared data simultaneously.\n",
    "- *Deadlocks*: Threads can become deadlocked if they wait indefinitely for resources held by each other.\n",

    "Deadlocks:\n",
    " A deadlock occurs when two or more threads are blocked forever, waiting for each other to release resources. This situation happens when threads acquire resources in different orders and end up waiting indefinitely for the other to release a resource they need.\n",
    "\n",
    "Race Conditions:\n",
    " A race condition occurs when the outcome of a program depends on the sequence or timing of uncontrollable events such as the order of thread execution. It often leads to unpredictable results and bugs that are hard to reproduce and fix. Race conditions typically occur when multiple threads read and write shared data simultaneously without proper synchronization."
