    "## Q1. What is Flask Framework? What are the advantages of Flask Framework?\n",
    "\n",
    "Flask is a lightweight web framework for Python. It is classified as a micro-framework because it does not require particular tools or libraries. It has no database abstraction layer, form validation, or other components where pre-existing third-party libraries provide common functions. Flask is designed to make getting started quick and easy, with the ability to scale up to complex applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Advantages of Flask Framework:*\n",
    "\n",
    "1. *Simplicity and Flexibility*: Flask is very simple to use, offering a flexible and modular design that allows developers to choose how they want to implement their applications.\n",
    "2. *Lightweight*: Flask has a small footprint and is easy to extend, making it ideal for smaller applications and microservices.\n",
    "3. *Minimalism*: With minimal boilerplate code, Flask applications are straightforward to write and maintain.\n",
    "4. *Extensible*: Flask is highly extensible and allows for the integration of any extensions needed to enhance functionality.\n",
    "5. *Good Documentation*: Flask has excellent documentation that helps developers understand and use the framework effectively.\n",
    "6. *Active Community*: Flask has a large and active community, which means plenty of third-party extensions, plugins, and libraries are available."
