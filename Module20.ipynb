    "The open() function is used to open a file in Python. The different modes of opening a file are:\n",
    "\n",
    "- 'r': Read mode (default). Opens a file for reading. If the file does not exist, it raises a FileNotFoundError.\n",
    "- 'w': Write mode. Opens a file for writing. If the file exists, it truncates the file to zero length. If the file does not exist, it creates a new file.\n",
    "- 'a': Append mode. Opens a file for writing. If the file exists, data is appended to the end of the file. If the file does not exist, it creates a new file.\n",
    "- 'x': Exclusive creation mode. Creates a new file. If the file already exists, it raises a FileExistsError.\n",
    "- 'b': Binary mode. Opens a file in binary mode.\n",
    "- 't': Text mode (default). Opens a file in text mode.\n",
    "- '+': Update mode. Opens a file for both reading and writing.\n",
    "\n",
    "Examples of combining modes:\n",
    "- 'rb': Read binary mode.\n",
    "- 'wb': Write binary mode.\n",
    "- 'r+': Read and write mode."
