    "## Q1. What are the three measures of central tendency?\n",
    "\n",
    "The three measures of central tendency are:\n",
    "1. Mean\n",
    "2. Median\n",
    "3. Mode\n",
    "\n",
    "## Q2. What is the difference between the mean, median, and mode? How are they used to measure the central tendency of a dataset?\n",
    "\n",
    "- *Mean*: The mean is the average of a dataset, calculated by summing all values and dividing by the number of values. It is useful for datasets without extreme outliers.\n",
    "  \n",
    "- *Median*: The median is the middle value when the dataset is ordered from least to greatest. If the dataset has an even number of values, it is the average of the two middle values. The median is useful for skewed datasets or those with outliers.\n",
    "  \n",
    "- *Mode*: The mode is the value that appears most frequently in the dataset. It is useful for categorical data or to identify the most common value in a dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Q3. Measure the three measures of central tendency for the given height data:\n",
    "\n",
    "Given height data: [178, 177, 176, 177, 178.2, 178, 175, 179, 180, 175, 178.9, 176.2, 177, 172.5, 178, 176.5]\n",
    "\n",
    "- *Mean*: Sum of the data values divided by the number of values.\n",
    "- *Median*: The middle value when the data is ordered.\n",
    "- *Mode*: The most frequently occurring value.\n",
    "\n",
    "   Measures of Central Tendency\n",
    "    Mean: 177.01875\n",
    "    Median: 177.0\n",
    "    Mode: 177.0\n",
    "\n",
    "## Q4. Find the standard deviation for the given data:\n",
    "\n",
    "Given data: [178, 177, 176, 177, 178.2, 178, 175, 179, 180, 175, 178.9, 176.2, 177, 172.5, 178, 176.5]\n",
    "\n",
    "Standard Deviation: 1.847\n",
    "\n",
    "## Q5. How are measures of dispersion such as range, variance, and standard deviation used to describe the spread of a dataset? Provide an example.\n",
    "\n",
    "- *Range*: The difference between the maximum and minimum values in a dataset. It gives a rough measure of variability.\n",
    "- *Variance*: The average of the squared differences from the mean. It provides a measure of how much values in the dataset differ from the mean.\n",
    "- *Standard Deviation*: The square root of the variance. It represents the average distance of each data point from the mean.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example: For the dataset [2, 4, 4, 4, 5, 5, 7, 9]:\n",
    "- Range: 9 - 2 = 7\n",
    "- Variance: ((2-5)^2 + (4-5)^2 + ... + (9-5)^2) / 8\n",
    "- Standard Deviation: √Variance\n",
    "\n",
    "## Q6. What is a Venn diagram?\n",
    "\n",
    "A Venn diagram is a visual representation of the relationships between different sets. It uses circles to represent sets and their relationships, such as intersections, unions, and differences.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Q7. For the two given sets A = {2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7} & B = {0, 2, 6, 8, 10}, find:\n",
    "\n",
    "(i) A ∩ B (Intersection): {2, 6}\n",
    "\n",
    "(ii) A ∪ B (Union): {0, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 10}\n",
    "\n",
    "## Q8. What do you understand about skewness in data?\n",
    "\n",
    "Skewness refers to the asymmetry of the distribution of values in a dataset. It can be:\n",
    "- *Positive skew (right skew)*: The tail on the right side is longer or fatter than the left.\n",
    "- *Negative skew (left skew)*: The tail on the left side is longer or fatter than the right.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Q9. If a data is right skewed then what will be the position of median with respect to mean?\n",
    "\n",
    "In a right-skewed distribution, the mean is typically greater than the median.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Q10. Explain the difference between covariance and correlation. How are these measures used in statistical analysis?\n",
    "\n",
    "- *Covariance*: Measures the extent to which two variables change together. It can be positive (both increase together) or negative (one increases as the other decreases).\n",
    "  \n",
    "- *Correlation*: Standardizes covariance to a value between -1 and 1, providing a measure of the strength and direction of the relationship between two variables. It is dimensionless and easier to interpret than covariance.\n",
    "\n",
    "Both are used to determine relationships between variables, with correlation providing a clearer measure of the strength of the relationship.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Q11. What is the formula for calculating the sample mean? Provide an example calculation for a dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "The formula for the sample mean is:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\[ \\bar{x} = \\frac{1}{n} \\sum_{i=1}^{n} x_i \\]\n",
    "\n",
    "Example calculation for the dataset [4, 8, 6, 5]:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\[ \\bar{x} = \\frac{4 + 8 + 6 + 5}{4} = 5.75 \\]\n",
    "\n",
    "## Q12. For a normal distribution data, what is the relationship between its measures of central tendency?\n",
    "\n",
    "For a normal distribution, the mean, median, and mode are all equal and located at the center of the distribution.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Q13. How is covariance different from correlation?\n",
    "\n",
    "Covariance measures the direction of the linear relationship between two variables but not the strength. Correlation measures both the strength and direction of the linear relationship and is standardized to a range between -1 and 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Q14. How do outliers affect measures of central tendency and dispersion? Provide an example.\n",
    "\n",
    "Outliers can significantly affect measures of central tendency and dispersion:\n",
    "- *Mean*: Outliers can skew the mean, making it higher or lower than the central value.\n",
    "- *Median*: Less affected by outliers as it is based on the middle value.\n",
    "- *Mode*: Not affected by outliers as it is based on frequency.\n",
    "- *Range*: Can be significantly increased by outliers.\n",
    "- *Variance and Standard Deviation*: Outliers increase these measures, indicating greater spread.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example: For the dataset [1, 2, 2, 3, 4, 100]:\n",
    "- Mean is heavily skewed by the outlier 100.\n",
    "- Median remains 2.5, not affected by the outlier.\n",
    "- Range is increased to 99.\n",
    "- Variance and standard deviation are also increased."
