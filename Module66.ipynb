    "## Q1. What is Elastic Net Regression and how does it differ from other regression techniques?\n",
    "\n",
    "Elastic Net Regression is a regularized regression technique that combines the penalties of both Lasso (L1) and Ridge (L2) methods. It is particularly useful when there are multiple features that are correlated with each other. The Elastic Net penalty is defined as:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\[ \\lambda_1 \\sum_{i=1}^{p} |\\beta_i| + \\lambda_2 \\sum_{i=1}^{p} \\beta_i^2 \\]\n",
    "\n",
    "where \\(\\lambda_1\\) and \\(\\lambda_2\\) are regularization parameters.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Differences from other techniques:*\n",
    "- *Ordinary Least Squares (OLS):* OLS doesn't include any regularization, so it can lead to overfitting when there are many features.\n",
    "- *Ridge Regression:* Only includes the L2 penalty, which can shrink coefficients towards zero but not exactly to zero, leading to no feature selection.\n",
    "- *Lasso Regression:* Only includes the L1 penalty, which can shrink some coefficients exactly to zero, effectively performing feature selection, but it can be unstable when features are highly correlated.\n",
    "- *Elastic Net:* Combines both L1 and L2 penalties, which can both perform feature selection (like Lasso) and handle correlated features better (like Ridge)."

    "## Q2. How do you choose the optimal values of the regularization parameters for Elastic Net Regression?\n",
    "\n",
    "Choosing the optimal values of \\(\\lambda_1\\) and \\(\\lambda_2\\) can be done using techniques such as cross-validation. Hereâ€™s a common approach:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. *Grid Search with Cross-Validation:* Define a grid of possible values for \\(\\lambda_1\\) and \\(\\lambda_2\\). For each combination, perform k-fold cross-validation and select the combination that minimizes the cross-validation error.\n",
    "2. *Random Search:* Instead of a grid, randomly sample the values for \\(\\lambda_1\\) and \\(\\lambda_2\\) within a specified range and perform cross-validation to find the best combination.\n",
    "3. *Automated Tools:* Use libraries like ElasticNetCV from scikit-learn in Python, which automatically performs cross-validation to find the best \\(\\lambda_1\\) and \\(\\lambda_2\\) values."

    "\n",
    "*Disadvantages:*\n",
    "- *Complexity:* More complex than OLS, Ridge, or Lasso due to the tuning of two parameters.\n",
    "- *Interpretability:* Less straightforward to interpret than OLS because of the regularization terms."

    "## Q5. How do you interpret the coefficients in Elastic Net Regression?\n",
    "\n",
    "Coefficients in Elastic Net Regression represent the change in the dependent variable for a one-unit change in the predictor variable, holding all other variables constant. Due to the regularization terms, some coefficients may be exactly zero (indicating feature exclusion), while non-zero coefficients are shrunk toward zero. The magnitude of the coefficients is less straightforward to interpret compared to OLS, as they are penalized and thus may not directly reflect the true effect sizes."

    "\n",
    "To handle missing values:\n",
    "1. *Imputation:* Use techniques such as mean, median, or mode imputation, or more sophisticated methods like K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) imputation, or iterative imputation.\n",
    "2. *Removing Missing Data:* If the amount of missing data is small, you can remove those rows or columns.\n",
    "\n",
    "Imputation is often preferred because it allows retaining as much data as possible. Libraries like scikit-learn provide classes like SimpleImputer and IterativeImputer for handling missing data."
