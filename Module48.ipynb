    "## Q1. Difference between a t-test and a z-test\n",
    "\n",
    "*T-test*:\n",
    "- Used when the sample size is small (typically n < 30) and the population standard deviation is unknown.\n",
    "- It accounts for the additional uncertainty introduced by estimating the population standard deviation from the sample.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Z-test*:\n",
    "- Used when the sample size is large (typically n ≥ 30) or when the population standard deviation is known.\n",
    "- Assumes the distribution of the sample mean is approximately normal.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Example Scenario*:\n",
    "- *T-test*: A researcher wants to compare the average test scores of a small group of 20 students to a national average.\n",
    "- *Z-test*: A quality control analyst wants to determine if the average weight of a large batch of products differs from the specified weight, given a known population standard deviation.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Q2. One-tailed vs Two-tailed tests\n",
    "\n",
    "- *One-tailed test*: Tests if the parameter is greater than or less than a certain value, but not both. It has more power to detect an effect in one direction.\n",
    "  - Example: Testing if a new drug increases patient recovery rate compared to the current drug.\n",
    "\n",
    "- *Two-tailed test*: Tests if the parameter is significantly different from a certain value in either direction.\n",
    "  - Example: Testing if a new teaching method results in a different average test score compared to the traditional method (could be higher or lower).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Q3. Type 1 and Type 2 errors\n",
    "\n",
    "- *Type 1 Error (α)*: Rejecting the null hypothesis when it is true (false positive).\n",
    "  - Example: Concluding a drug is effective when it actually has no effect.\n",
    "\n",
