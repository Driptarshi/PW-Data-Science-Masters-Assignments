    "## Q1: What are the Probability Mass Function (PMF) and Probability Density Function (PDF)? Explain with an example.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Probability Mass Function (PMF):*\n",
    "The PMF is a function that gives the probability that a discrete random variable is exactly equal to some value. It applies to discrete random variables, which take on a countable number of distinct values.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example: Consider a fair six-sided die. The PMF for rolling the die is:\n",
    "\\[ P(X = x) = \\frac{1}{6} \\quad \\text{for } x = 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 \\]\n",
    "\n",
    "*Probability Density Function (PDF):*\n",
    "The PDF is a function that describes the likelihood of a continuous random variable to take on a particular value. The probability of the variable falling within a particular range is given by the integral of this function over that range.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example: For a standard normal distribution, the PDF is:\n",
    "\\[ f(x) = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2\\pi}} e^{-\\frac{x^2}{2}} \\]\n",
    "\n",
    "## Q2: What is Cumulative Density Function (CDF)? Explain with an example. Why CDF is used?\n",
    "\n",
    "*Cumulative Density Function (CDF):*\n",
    "The CDF of a random variable \\( X \\) is the function \\( F(x) \\) that gives the probability that \\( X \\) will take a value less than or equal to \\( x \\). It is defined for both discrete and continuous random variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example: For a fair six-sided die, the CDF is:\n",
    "\\[ F(x) = P(X \\leq x) = \\begin{cases} \n",
    "0 & \\text{for } x < 1 \\\\\n",
    "\\frac{1}{6} & \\text{for } 1 \\leq x < 2 \\\\\n",
    "\\frac{2}{6} & \\text{for } 2 \\leq x < 3 \\\\\n",
    "\\frac{3}{6} & \\text{for } 3 \\leq x < 4 \\\\\n",
    "\\frac{4}{6} & \\text{for } 4 \\leq x < 5 \\\\\n",
    "\\frac{5}{6} & \\text{for } 5 \\leq x < 6 \\\\\n",
    "1 & \\text{for } x \\geq 6 \n",
    "\\end{cases} \\]\n",
    "\n",
    "*Usage of CDF:*\n",
    "The CDF is useful because it provides a comprehensive way to describe the distribution of a random variable. It is particularly helpful in calculating probabilities for intervals and for continuous random variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Q3: What are some examples of situations where the normal distribution might be used as a model? Explain how the parameters of the normal distribution relate to the shape of the distribution.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Examples:*\n",
    "1. Heights of adults in a population.\n",
    "2. Scores on standardized tests (e.g., SAT, IQ tests).\n",
    "3. Measurement errors in scientific experiments.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Parameters:*\n",
    "- *Mean (\\(\\mu\\))*: Determines the center of the distribution. Changing \\(\\mu\\) shifts the distribution left or right.\n",
    "- *Standard Deviation (\\(\\sigma\\))*: Determines the spread of the distribution. A larger \\(\\sigma\\) results in a wider and flatter curve, while a smaller \\(\\sigma\\) results in a narrower and taller curve.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Q4: Explain the importance of Normal Distribution. Give a few real-life examples of Normal Distribution.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Importance:*\n",
    "The normal distribution is important because it naturally arises in many situations due to the Central Limit Theorem. It is a key assumption in many statistical methods and models.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Real-life Examples:*\n",
    "1. Heights and weights of individuals.\n",
    "2. Test scores in education.\n",
    "3. Measurement errors in scientific studies.\n",
    "4. Financial returns in the stock market.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Q5: What is Bernoulli Distribution? Give an Example. What is the difference between Bernoulli Distribution and Binomial Distribution?\n",
    "\n",
    "*Bernoulli Distribution:*\n",
    "A Bernoulli distribution is a discrete probability distribution for a random variable which has only two possible outcomes, typically labeled 1 (success) and 0 (failure), with probability \\( p \\) and \\( 1-p \\) respectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example: Flipping a coin where heads = 1 (success) and tails = 0 (failure), with \\( p = 0.5 \\).\n",
    "\n",
    "*Difference:*\n",
    "- *Bernoulli Distribution*: Represents a single trial.\n",
    "- *Binomial Distribution*: Represents the number of successes in \\( n \\) independent Bernoulli trials.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Q6: Consider a dataset with a mean of 50 and a standard deviation of 10. If we assume that the dataset is normally distributed, what is the probability that a randomly selected observation will be greater than 60? Use the appropriate formula and show your calculations.\n",
    "\n",
    "To find this probability, we first calculate the z-score for 60:\n",
    "\\[ z = \\frac{X - \\mu}{\\sigma} = \\frac{60 - 50}{10} = 1 \\]\n",
    "\n",
    "Using the z-table, the probability that \\( Z \\) is less than 1 is approximately 0.8413. Therefore, the probability that \\( Z \\) is greater than 1 is:\n",
    "\\[ P(Z > 1) = 1 - P(Z < 1) = 1 - 0.8413 = 0.1587 \\]\n",
    "\n",
    "So, the probability that a randomly selected observation will be greater than 60 is 0.1587.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Q7: Explain uniform Distribution with an example.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Uniform Distribution:*\n",
    "A uniform distribution is a type of probability distribution in which all outcomes are equally likely. Every interval of the same length within the distribution's range has an equal probability.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example: Rolling a fair six-sided die. Each outcome (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6) has an equal probability of \\( \\frac{1}{6} \\).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Q8: What is the z-score? State the importance of the z-score.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Z-score:*\n",
    "A z-score indicates how many standard deviations an element is from the mean of the distribution. It is calculated as:\n",
    "\\[ z = \\frac{X - \\mu}{\\sigma} \\]\n",
    "\n",
    "*Importance:*\n",
    "- Allows comparison of scores from different distributions.\n",
    "- Helps identify outliers.\n",
    "- Facilitates the calculation of probabilities in a standard normal distribution.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Q9: What is Central Limit Theorem? State the significance of the Central Limit Theorem.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Central Limit Theorem (CLT):*\n",
    "The CLT states that the sampling distribution of the sample mean approaches a normal distribution as the sample size becomes large, regardless of the population's distribution.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Significance:*\n",
    "- Allows the use of normal distribution approximations for inferential statistics.\n",
    "- Justifies many statistical procedures and tests.\n",
    "- Helps in making predictions and decisions based on sample data.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Q10: State the assumptions of the Central Limit Theorem.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Assumptions:*\n",
    "1. The samples must be independent.\n",
    "2. The sample size should be sufficiently large (typically \\( n \\geq 30 \\) is considered adequate).\n",
    "3. The population should have a finite variance."
